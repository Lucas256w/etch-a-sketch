# etch-a-sketch
Developed a dynamic etch-a-sketch web application utilizing JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Created a 16x16 grid of square divs with the ability to change the number of squares upto 64x64 based on a slider function. Implemented grid display technique using flexbox. Designed an interactive press and move effect that changes the color of the grids as the mouse presses and passes over them.
